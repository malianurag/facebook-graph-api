## Welcome to Facebook graph api demo Repository

  This is demo for the facebook api. I have tried to show you, how we can access your facebook information using facebook graph api. Provided you should give access token ad all the necessary permissions.
	Facebook graph api is one of the coolest api available on the web. This gives access to almost all the information associated with your profile. Also this api is highly secured from hacks and leak of sensetive information. Facebook changes token after certian period of time, so that no one can use it for long time. Also user is informed about access of the token and asked for permission. Access level can be customized.
  Your guidance & suggestions will be appreciated. Thank you
